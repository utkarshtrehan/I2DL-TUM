    "1. Go on [our submission page](https://dvl.in.tum.de/teaching/submission/), register for an account and login. We use your matriculation number and send an email with the login details to the mail account associated. When in doubt, login into tum online and check your mails there. You will get an id which we need in the next step.\n",
    "2. Navigate to `exercise_code` directory and run the `create_submission.sh` file to create the zip file of your model. This will create a single `zip` file that you need to upload. Otherwise, you can also zip it manually if you don't want to use the bash script.\n",
    "3. Log into [our submission page](https://dvl.in.tum.de/teaching/submission/) with your account details and upload the `zip` file. Once successfully uploaded, you should be able to see the submitted \"dummy_model.p\" file selectable on the top.\n",

The only thing that's required to pass the submission, is your model to reach at least **48% accuracy** on __our__ test dataset. The submission system will show you a number between 0 and 100 which corresponds to your accuracy.\n",
